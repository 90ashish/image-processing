Why This Project?

By implementing each layer—from protobuf schema design through security, observability, REST/Browser exposure, service discovery, testing, and container orchestration—you’ll encounter and master every major gRPC concept and ecosystem tool. Feel free to clone, code alongside, then extend:

    Add file-upload checkpointing

    Plug in JWT or OAuth for auth interceptor

    Hook up real image-processing libraries

    Scale processing across multiple workers

This hands-on mega-project will cement both the core RPC patterns and the advanced production-grade features of gRPC.
